# Final-Project-java

This repository is for Appointment-Calendar java project

Folder structure for project is as below. 

Team has deveoped 2 methods to generate and test calendar functionality. We are going to finalize  1st method which is 
easier to implement all required features but as additional work we are also testing what are other ways for calendar so we have kept both for now.

1st Method: Calendar.java -> This file contain our code using try and catch method and ability to select slots

2nd Method: Calendar1.java-> 
This is little complex work using inheritance It contains super class and sub-class calendar2.java and generates 2 files A.txt for professor and B.txt for students.
src/main/java - will contain all source code classes src/main/test - will contain some test cases For 2nd method we added test cases to read txt file and generate in html format for calendar.
target/ - will hold generated calendars and text files. 

Currently this is work in progress.

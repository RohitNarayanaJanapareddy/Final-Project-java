# Final-Project-java

This repository is for Appointment-Calendar java project

Summary:

1.Calendar.java is main class which generates calendar.txt and calendars.txt. 
  calendar.txt gets updated everytime student makes an update. It contains booked by field for 
  professor view. Other file calendars.txt is used for student's view. It does not contain booked by field.

2. Maven test case CalendarTest converts calendars.txt into calendar.html .
3. Another test Calendar2Test is used to manually transfer calendar.html to network.
4. Calendar3Test is used for automated push to git to display calendar but this code
   is not working correctly.
5. We implemented feature of hiding code for professor but IDE doesnot support that console read password 
   feature so if Professor wants to view then he can run on terminal as java Calendar.java.
6. We are further trying to improve Calendar html look.
